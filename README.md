 Front End Final Project – Win Cheng P15238364
-----------------------------------------------

-------------
Introduction:
-------------

The website required a few drafts to get right.
It started off as a scrolling page which had random information. 
When the first draft was done it was quite basic, 
so I thought up what type of information I like in my website and it was space.
I started to mix up the pages with scrolling and animation effects.

---------------------------
Successful Implementations:
---------------------------
Scrolling page on index

CSS – Breakpoints to control viewpoint,
Controlling the objects from moving out of place,
Designing the Webpage to look presentable. Small Transitions, 
 
CSS hover effects – blur effects, highlight colours

JavaScript – Google API (Markers and Search Bar)[Reference: https://developers.google.com/maps/], 
NASA API (Picture of the Day) [Reference: https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#live_example]


-----------------------------
Unsuccessful Implementations:
-----------------------------
jQuery – I wanted the user to click on a tab to scroll down to a certain page but found an issue with JavaScript and Index pages.

JavaScript: Creating a game was difficult. I was learning from YouTube, but some things were not working properly.
 I left a folder called New folder this has all the JS, CSS, and Index page for it. 

CSS Flex – Tried to use Flex with my image but probably I don’t understand it to well in order to make it work.
