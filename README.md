 Front End Final Project – Website
-----------------------------------

-------------
Introduction:
-------------

The website required a few drafts to get right.
It started off as a scrolling page which had random information. 
When the first draft was done it was quite basic, 
so I thought up what type of information I like in my website and it was space.
I started to mix up the pages with scrolling and animation effects.
