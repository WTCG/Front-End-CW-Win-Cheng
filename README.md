 Front End Final Project – Win Cheng P15238364

Introduction:
-------------

The website required a few drafts to get right.
It started off as a scrolling page which had random information.

Then it clicked what was something interesting that I wanted to do was space.

Draft 1 showed what I did but felt like not enough was in there. So i remade the website
with my past experienced and hopefully draft 2 is better.

---------------------------
Successful Implementations:
---------------------------
Scrolling page on index

CSS – Breakpoints to control viewpoint,
Controlling the objects from moving out of place,
Designing the Webpage to look presentable. Small Transitions, 
 
CSS hover effects – blur effects, highlight colours

JavaScript – Google API (Sucessfully put in Markers and used the idea of Search Bar)[Reference: https://developers.google.com/maps/], 
NASA API (Picture of the Day) [Reference: https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#live_example]

Modal-effect - About page which is telescope around the world has an affect which let image go full screen like a pop up. 
I used W3chool to help me when using this effect.

Text Box JavaScript Validation - This JavaScript allows to validate whether there is text within a text box or not and if not it will show an error.
I used reference: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation.asp - to help me in my work. I test run it using their server before i implement it in my work.

-----------------------------
Unsuccessful Implementations:
-----------------------------
jQuery – I wanted the user to click on a tab to scroll down to a certain page but found an issue with JavaScript and Index pages.

JavaScript: Creating a game was difficult. I was learning from YouTube, but some things were not working properly.
 I left a folder called New folder this has all the JS, CSS, and Index page for it. 

CSS Flex – Tried to use Flex with my image but probably I don’t understand it to well in order to make it work. 

Accesibility - I wanted the pages to go into a colour blind mode but there were some problems finding sources to help myself.

--------------------
correcting problems:
--------------------

API and Modal Effect Conflict - The problem is that the api had same naming conventions. I tried my bes to solve the issues but nothing was working.
I had to make another javascript file called appcss.js to put in the modal effectjs. This was a workaround.
